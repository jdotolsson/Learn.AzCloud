# What are we trying to accomplish?

1. Web.Api
2. Open API 3 support and documentation
3. Logging with SeriLog
4. Application Insights
5. ProblemDetails implementation according to [RFC 7807](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807)

## Application
Bookstore is a API application that lists and selling books.
Altough we will not build the 'buying' part right now.
We will focus on Books and thier reviews.

This learning series will develop over time and we will focus on things and stuff that you decide.

### Part_1
This part, will focus mostly on setting the API up so we have the main understanding of the infrastructure.
If we are quick, we will also be able to deploy the application to the cloud.
